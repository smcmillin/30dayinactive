O365 Powershell Script

This is the script I use at work to see if a user account has fallen through the cracks and didn't get blocked when a staff member has been offboarded. It doesn't take any action against the user account, it just exports their email to a csv for review. That csv could easily be imported into another script for automated blocking.

I used this script to help clean up my org's user accounts. We went from 300 active user accounts down to 150.
